# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}
This code runs a game that was made using pygame. The game is really simple and the objective is to use the arrow keys to move your guy and avoid the raining projectiles. 
If you hit a projectile then the game ends. One feature that I like was the time counter in the top corner, so that way you can see how long you have been playing.


{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with the pygame libriary and enhance my python skills so that way I can better be prepared to work on and help on the team project.
This will be helpful because for our team project we are making a game with pygame.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
